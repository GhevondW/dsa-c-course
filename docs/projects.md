### 1\. `C-Vector`: A Dynamic Array Library

# Project Title: `C-Vector` - A Generic Dynamic Array Library

## Overview

C++ has `std::vector`, a powerful tool for managing dynamic arrays. C arrays, however, are fixed in size. This project is about creating `C-Vector`, a library that provides a generic, type-safe dynamic array (vector) implementation in C. The library will manage its own memory, growing as needed when new elements are added.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a vector.
  - Get the current size and capacity of the vector.
  - Add an element to the end (`push_back`).
  - Remove an element from the end (`pop_back`).
  - Get or set the element at a specific index.
  - Automatically resize (grow) the internal array when its capacity is reached.

## Demo Application Idea

A command-line program that reads an unknown number of integers from the user, stores them in a `C-Vector`, and then prints them out along with the final size and capacity of the vector.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Dynamic Memory Management**: `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`.
  - **Amortized Analysis**: Understanding the performance of resizing.
  - **Generic Programming in C**: Using `void*` and `memcpy` to handle any data type.
  - **API Design**: Creating a clean and reusable interface.

### 2\. `C-RPN`: A Stack-Based RPN Calculator Engine

# Project Title: `C-RPN` - A Reverse Polish Notation Calculator Engine

## Overview

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where operators follow their operands. For example, `3 + 4` is written as `3 4 +`. RPN expressions can be evaluated efficiently using a stack. This project is to create a library that parses and computes the result of an RPN expression string.

## Core Features

  - A robust, generic **stack implementation** for numbers (e.g., `double`).
  - A primary evaluation function that takes an RPN expression as a string (e.g., `"10 5 / 3 *"`).
  - Support for basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
  - Robust error handling for malformed expressions (e.g., insufficient operands, division by zero, invalid tokens).

## Demo Application Idea

A command-line RPN calculator. The program takes a single command-line argument—an RPN expression in quotes—evaluates it using your library, and prints the result or an error message.
`./rpn_calculator "15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -"`

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Stack Application**: A classic, practical use case for the stack data structure.
  - **String Parsing**: Using `strtok_r` or similar functions to break a string into tokens.
  - **Error Handling**: Designing an API that clearly communicates different failure modes.
  - **State Management**: Managing the stack's state throughout the evaluation process.

### 3\. `C-TaskQueue`: A FIFO Task Queue Library

# Project Title: `C-TaskQueue` - A Simple FIFO Task Queue

## Overview

Queues are fundamental in computing for managing tasks or events in a "first-come, first-served" manner. This project is to build a generic, queue-based library for managing a list of "tasks." A task will be represented by a function pointer, allowing the library to queue up different actions to be executed in order.

## Core Features

  - A robust, generic **queue implementation** (using a linked list is a good choice).
  - An API to add a task (a function pointer and its argument) to the back of the queue (`enqueue`).
  - An API to retrieve and remove the next task from the front of the queue (`dequeue`).
  - A helper function to run all tasks in the queue until it is empty.

## Demo Application Idea

A simple event simulator. The demo program will define several functions (e.g., `on_user_login(char* username)`, `on_file_download(char* filename)`, `on_db_query(char* query)`). The `main` function will add these tasks to the queue in a specific order. Finally, it will call `task_queue_run()` to execute all the queued tasks sequentially, printing messages to show they are running in the correct FIFO order.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Queue Application**: Understanding how queues are used for task scheduling and event loops.
  - **Function Pointers**: A powerful C feature for creating flexible, callback-driven systems.
  - **Generic Programming**: Using `void*` to pass arbitrary data to task functions.
  - **Decoupling**: Separating the "what" (the task functions) from the "when" (the queue's execution logic).

### 4\. `C-HashMap`: A Hash Map Library

# Project Title: `C-HashMap` - A Key-Value Hash Map Library

## Overview

Many modern languages have built-in dictionaries or hash maps. This project involves building a hash map in C to store key-value pairs. Your library should handle string keys and `void*` values, allowing it to store any type of data. It must efficiently handle hash collisions.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a hash map.
  - Insert a key-value pair.
  - Retrieve a value given a key.
  - Delete a key-value pair.
  - Check if a key exists.
  - Implement a string hashing function (e.g., djb2).
  - Handle collisions using **chaining** (linked lists at each bucket).

## Demo Application Idea

A word frequency counter. The demo program should read a text file, use the `C-HashMap` library to store each unique word as a key and its frequency count as the value, and then print the results.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Hashing**: Designing hash functions and handling collisions.
  - **Data Structures**: Combining arrays and linked lists.
  - **Pointer Management**: Managing memory for keys, values, and nodes.
  - **API Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details from the user.

### 5\. `C-StringUtils`: An Enhanced String Utility Library

# Project Title: `C-StringUtils` - A Safer String Utility Library

## Overview

Standard C string handling (`<string.h>`) is powerful but prone to buffer overflows and memory management errors. This project is to create a library that provides higher-level, safer, and more convenient string manipulation functions, similar to what's available in other languages.

## Core Features

  - **Split**: A function to split a string by a delimiter into an array of strings.
  - **Join**: A function to join an array of strings into a single string with a separator.
  - **Trim**: Functions to remove leading/trailing whitespace from a string.
  - **Dynamic String**: A `string_buffer` struct that can be appended to without manual `realloc` calls, similar to `std::string`.

## Demo Application Idea

A program that reads a line of comma-separated values (CSV), splits it into fields using your library, trims whitespace from each field, and then joins them back together with a different delimiter (e.g., a pipe `|`).

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **String Manipulation**: Deep understanding of C-style strings (`char*`).
  - **Advanced Memory Management**: Allocating and freeing arrays of pointers.
  - **Defensive Programming**: Creating APIs that are harder to misuse.

### 6\. `C-Graph`: A Graph Algorithms Toolkit

# Project Title: `C-Graph` - A Graph Data Structure and Algorithms Library

## Overview

This project packages fundamental graph algorithms into a reusable C library. The library should provide a single, clean interface for creating graphs, adding nodes and edges, and running classic algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's.

## Core Features

  - Define a graph data structure (using an **adjacency list** is recommended).
  - Functions to create directed or undirected graphs.
  - Functions to add/remove vertices and edges (both weighted and unweighted).
  - An implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** that returns the path.
  - An implementation of **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.
  - An implementation of **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

## Demo Application Idea

A simple pathfinding program. The demo could define a small city map as a graph (intersections are vertices, roads are edges with travel times as weights) and find the fastest route between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Graph Representations**: Adjacency lists vs. matrices.
  - **Algorithm Implementation**: Translating textbook algorithms into clean code.
  - **Data Encapsulation**: Hiding the graph's internal structure behind an API.
  - **Modular Design**: Separating the data structure from the algorithms that operate on it.

### 7\. `C-PriorityQueue`: A Generic Min-Heap/Priority Queue

# Project Title: `C-PriorityQueue` - A Generic Priority Queue Library

## Overview

Implement a generic priority queue based on a **binary min-heap**. This data structure is essential for many algorithms (like Dijkstra's or Prim's) and scheduling systems. The library should allow users to insert items with a priority and always be able to extract the item with the highest priority (lowest numerical value).

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a priority queue.
  - Insert an element with an associated priority (or value).
  - Extract the element with the minimum value (`extract_min`).
  - Peek at the minimum element without removing it.
  - Store `void*` data pointers to be generic, with priority being an `int` or `double`.

## Demo Application Idea

A task scheduler. The demo prompts the user to add tasks with different priority levels (1=high, 5=low). The program uses the priority queue to store tasks and then "executes" them by always extracting the one with the lowest priority number.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Heaps**: Understanding the heap data structure and its properties.
  - **Array-based Tree Representation**: Mapping a binary tree to an array.
  - **Algorithm Efficiency**: O(log n) insertions and extractions.

### 8\. `C-SortSuite`: A Generic Sorting Algorithms Library

# Project Title: `C-SortSuite` - A Generic Sorting Library

## Overview

Create a library that provides implementations of several efficient sorting algorithms. The library should be generic, capable of sorting an array of any data type, just like C's standard `qsort` function. This is achieved by using function pointers for comparison.

## Core Features

  - Implementations of **Quicksort** and **Mergesort**.
  - A single sorting interface that takes an array (`void*`), element count, element size, and a comparison function pointer.
  - The comparison function should follow the same signature as the one for `qsort`.

## Demo Application Idea

A program that defines an array of custom structs (e.g., `struct Person { char* name; int age; }`). The demo will use your library to sort this array first by name (alphabetically) and then by age (numerically) by providing two different comparison functions.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Function Pointers**: A core concept for creating generic, callback-style APIs in C.
  - **Generic Programming**: Using `void*` to write type-agnostic code.
  - **Sorting Algorithms**: Deepening the understanding of quicksort and mergesort.

### 9\. `C-Deque`: A Double-Ended Queue Library

# Project Title: `C-Deque` - A Generic Double-Ended Queue

## Overview

A deque (pronounced "deck") is a data structure that allows adding and removing elements from both the front and the back. This project is to build a generic deque library in C, which can be implemented efficiently using a circular array.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a deque.
  - `push_front`: Add an element to the beginning.
  - `push_back`: Add an element to the end.
  - `pop_front`: Remove an element from the beginning.
  - `pop_back`: Remove an element from the end.
  - Get the current size of the deque.

## Demo Application Idea

A palindrome checker. Read a string from the user, push each character to the back of a deque. Then, repeatedly pop from the front and back, comparing characters until the deque is empty. If all pairs match, it's a palindrome.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Circular Arrays**: Efficiently managing a queue in a fixed-size block of memory.
  - **Index Management**: Logic for wrapping `head` and `tail` pointers.
  - **Data Structure Design**: Implementing a less common but useful data structure.
